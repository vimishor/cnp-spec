This repository contains the specification for _Personal Identification Number_ (_<abbr title="Cod Numeric Personal">C.N.P.</abbr>_).

## Overview

Because no specification (_official or 3rd party_) exists for _Personal Identification Number_, reading the laws and methodological norms which regulate the structure of a _Personal Identification Number_ was a necessary step before writing an implementation.

Because nobody likes to read laws, most of the times this step was skipped entirely and the implementation was based on different published articles, which most of the times made wrong assumption(s) and/or recommendation(s), resulting in erroneous implementations.

This specification tries to compress the entire information related to C.N.P. from laws and methodological norms which regulate it, in order to offer some guidance to software engineers and developers in understanding and implementing _C.N.P._ validation.
